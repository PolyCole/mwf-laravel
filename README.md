# mwf-laravel
This repository is part of my distinction project to achieve honors in Computer Science. In the project, I examined five of the most popular front and back-end web frameworks, took a look at the functionality they provide, where their limitations lie, and how they can be leveraged to produce high-quality web solutions.

This repository in specific is the portion of my project implemented with Laravel and Vue. One of the critical things I learned from this implementation is how incredibly powerful separation of concerns can be. Since I built this implementation using Laravel as an API and Vue as an SPA, I found a clear delineation of work between the two components, and breaking down which technology would handle which functionality was quite straight forward. 

If you'd like, you can also see the Django & React implementation that's another part of this project [here](https://github.com/PolyCole/mwf-django).
